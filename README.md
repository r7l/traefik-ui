# Traefik UI

This repository only contains the WebUI automatically build from Traefik. It does not add any additional features.

The only reason for this repository is Traefik using obsolete NodeJS 14.x which is no longer being shipped with Gentoo and the last known Ebuild of NodeJS 14.x wasn't even compatible with OpenSSL 3.x. This complicates things allot and this repo helps maintaining a custom Ebuild for Traefik.
